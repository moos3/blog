&lt;h3 id=&#34;finally-backup&#34;&gt;Finally Backup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have decided its time for a new site and blog. I have been playing with
this idea for a while. I have been really busy at work and in my personal life.
I originally started a blog back in 2004 and now here we are in 2015. With more
blog options then ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;engine-choice&#34;&gt;Engine Choice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I picked my blog engine I knew I never wanted to have a database
server. I wanted the ability to throw this up on any thing that can serve html
statically. Theres a TON of static site generators all over the place. There
are written in various languages. I choose hugo written in GOLANG because one
I wanted to learn GOLANG and two its extremely well used based off my research
on github.&lt;/p&gt;
